HTML History
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/what-is-html/
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was developed to create and connect documents on the early World Wide Web. It has evolved through several versions, each adding new features and improving the web experience.
- HTML 1 -> HTML 2 -> HTML 3 -> HTML 4 -> HTML 4.01 -> HTML 5
- 1993   -> 1995   -> 1997   -> 1999   -> 2012      -> 2014

Paragraph elements
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-paragraph/
- A paragraph in HTML is simply a block of text enclosed within the <p> tag. The <p> tag helps divide content into manageable, readable sections. It’s the go-to element for wrapping text in a web page that is meant to be displayed as a distinct paragraph.
- Adds space before and after the paragraph to visually separate it from other content.
- Breaks the text into a single block, creating an easy-to-read section.

Properties of the paragraph Tag
- The browser reduces multiple spaces added by users to a single space.
- If a user adds various lines, the browser compresses them into one line.
- By default, the display of the paragraph element is set to "block," meaning each new paragraph is placed on a new line. Note: This behaviour can be modified using CSS.

HTML Headings
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-heading/
- HTML headings are used to define the titles and subtitles of sections on a webpage. They help organize the content and create a structure that is easy to navigate.
- Proper use of headings enhances readability by organizing content into clear sections.
- Search engines utilize headings to understand page structure, aiding in SEO.
- The below code uses HTML heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) to create headings that range from the main heading to the smallest subheading.
- Each tag shows the hierarchy of the content, helping organize the structure of the webpage.

code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" 
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
	<h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
	<h3>This is a Smaller Subheading</h3>
	<h4>This is a Sub-Subheading</h4>
	<h5>This is a Minor Subheading</h5>
	<h6>This is the Smallest Heading</h6>
</body>
</html>

Levels of HTML Heading Tags
- HTML offers six levels of heading tags, each serving a different purpose in structuring your content:
	- <h1> – Main Heading (Largest)
		- Represents the primary focus of the page, usually used for the main title.
		- Use only one <h1> tag per page for the best SEO practices.
		- Makes it clear to both users and search engines what the main topic is.
	- <h2> – Subheadings
		- Ideal for dividing the content into major sections.
		- If the content has further subsections, use <h3> to create a logical flow.
	- <h3> to <h6> – Smaller Headings
		- These heading levels are used for finer subdivisions, gradually decreasing in size and importance.
		- <h3> is used for subsections under <h2>, while <h4> to <h6> are used for additional, less important subdivisions.
		- <h6> defines the least important heading.
