The Request/Response Cycle

- The user sends a request for a resource to a server
- The server processes it and gives the response.
- The browser takes the instructions for the page/resource and runs it to build the page.
- To see the instructions, right click on any page in internet and select View page source
- View page source gives the underlying page, the content that results in the web page.
- For example, when the user searches in google, a HTTP req is sent to google server.
	The server build the page/resource and sends HTTP response which contains HTML CSS and JS code.
	The browser gets the response and renders the page based on code it received.
